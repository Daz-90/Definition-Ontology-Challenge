The Definition Challenge
A rule based ontology and applied physics project

This repository contains a single integrated project released as six documents.
The files are ordered for reader continuity and narrative stability rather than strict dependency order.

Reading order

1. Definition Ontology OS MASTER
2. Ontology Extras Project Dictionary
3. Cosmology Boundaries and Resistance
4. Stress Balanced Gravitation Reformulation Gravity via Equilibrium
5. AST
6. Field First Engineering

Files in this repository

Definition Ontology_OS_MASTER.docx  
Role  
Foundational definition and constraint discipline.  
This document establishes the rules of meaning, identity, persistence, and collapse used by all other files.

Ontology_Extras_Project_Dictionary.docx  
Role  
Alphabetical dictionary of project terms.  
This file exists as a reference layer to prevent ambiguity and reader drift during reading.

Cosmology_Boundaries_and_Resistance.docx  
Role  
Cosmological framing under boundary, resistance, and observability constraints.  
This document remains model agnostic and does not replace standard cosmological models.

Stress-Balanced Gravitation - Reformulation Gravity via Equilibrium.docx  
Role  
Gravity reframed as an equilibrium response to resistance and geometry rather than force exchange.  
Includes test posture and compatibility aims with existing observational results.

AST.docx  
Role  
Autogenic Separation Theory.  
Cognition and consciousness described as physical emergence under constraint without non physical entities.

Field_First_Engineering.docx  
Role  
Applied layer.  
Demonstrates how ontology and physics constraints guide field first system design and engineering decisions.

What this project is not

This project is not a rejection of established physics.  
It is not metaphysics or mysticism.  
It is not institutional critique.  
It is not persuasion by authority.

Status

Independent research.  
Released for structural critique, logical challenge, and test oriented discussion.
