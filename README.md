# The Definition Challenge — A Rule-Based Foundational Ontology

This repository contains a full ontology constructed from zero assumptions, released as a devil’s advocate challenge.

It is not alternative physics. It is a rule-constrained definitional framework aimed at rebuilding core concepts such as identity, relation, dimensionality, information, collapse, and entropy without circular definitions or hidden assumptions.

## The Challenge

The rules are strict:
- no circular definitions  
- no geometric assumptions  
- no metaphysical shortcuts  
- any contradiction breaks the system  

If a reader can find a contradiction or rule violation, the ontology fails.  
If not, the definitions may offer clearer conceptual foundations than standard scientific language.

## Files Included
• **Definition Ontology** — full rule-first framework  
• **Ontology Extras** — domain translations (forces, collapse, entropy, light, matter, black holes)

## Purpose
This is released publicly for critique, analysis, and devil’s advocate testing by anyone interested in conceptual physics, ontology, or philosophical foundations.

## License
This work follows the same license used in the Zenodo release (CC BY 4.0).
